            Hi Mailbird Support,
            
            I'm having trouble with my email not syncing properly. My Gmail account seems to be stuck and I'm not receiving new emails. 
            
            How can I fix this issue? I've tried restarting the app but it doesn't help.
            
            Thanks for your help!

            <p>Thanks for the quick response! I followed your steps but I'm still having issues. The connection test says "Failed to connect - Authentication error".</p>
            
            <p>What should I do next?</p>

            <p>I see the issue now - it's an authentication problem. This usually happens when:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Your password has changed recently</li>
                <li>2-factor authentication is enabled</li>
                <li>App-specific passwords are required</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>Please try this:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Go to your Google Account settings</li>
                <li>Enable "Less secure app access" OR create an App Password</li>
                <li>Use the App Password in Mailbird instead of your regular password</li>
            </ol>
            
            <p>This should resolve the authentication error. Let me know how it goes!</p>

            <p>Perfect! Creating an App Password worked perfectly. My emails are syncing now.</p>
            
            <p>Thank you so much for your help!</p>

            <p>Wonderful! I'm glad we got that sorted out for you. ðŸŽ‰</p>
            
            <p>For future reference, if you change your Google password, you'll need to update the App Password in Mailbird as well.</p>
            
            <p>Feel free to reach out if you need any other assistance. Have a great day!</p>
