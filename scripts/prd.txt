# MB-Sparrow Multi-Agent System PRD

## Project Overview
Enhance and extend the existing multi-agent AI system with improved task management, better coordination between agents, and streamlined development workflows.

## Current System
- Agent 4.0 multi-agent architecture
- RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) capabilities  
- Web search integration (Brave Search API)
- Natural Language Web interaction
- Data ingestion and processing
- Vector database integration (ChromaDB)
- Streamlit frontend
- MCP (Model Context Protocol) integration

## Goals
1. Integrate Task Master AI for better project management
2. Improve agent coordination and communication
3. Enhance the Streamlit frontend with better UX
4. Optimize vector database operations
5. Add comprehensive testing coverage
6. Implement monitoring and logging improvements
