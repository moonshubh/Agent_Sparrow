Last updated: 2026-02-23

Track persistent documentation blind spots that frequently slow implementation.

## Open Gaps

| Gap | Impact | Mitigation | Owner |
|---|---|---|---|
| (none) | - | - | - |

## Process

1. Log recurring gap with concrete examples.
2. Add temporary fallback source.
3. Update `ref-source-registry.md` when stabilized.
