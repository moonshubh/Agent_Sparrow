# Frontend Fix Verification Checklist

## 🚀 Integration Complete!

Frontend is now running at: **http://localhost:3001**

## ✅ Verification Steps

### 1. Rate Limit Indicator
- [ ] Open http://localhost:3001 in your browser
- [ ] Look for the rate limit indicator in the header (usually top-right)
- [ ] Verify it shows usage data (e.g., "10/100 requests")
- [ ] Check console for any rate limit API errors

### 2. FeedMe Features
- [ ] Click on the FeedMe button in the header
- [ ] Verify the FeedMe modal opens without errors
- [ ] Test uploading a conversation (file or text)
- [ ] Check that folders load correctly
- [ ] Verify WebSocket connection status (should show "Connected")

### 3. Console Monitoring
- [ ] Open browser DevTools (F12)
- [ ] Go to Console tab
- [ ] Look for any red error messages
- [ ] Expected: No errors related to FeedMe or rate limits

## 🔍 What to Look For

### Success Indicators:
- ✅ Rate limit shows numbers like "5/100" or similar
- ✅ FeedMe modal opens smoothly
- ✅ Folders display in the sidebar
- ✅ No red errors in console
- ✅ WebSocket shows "Real-time updates are now active"

### If Issues Persist:
1. **Clear browser cache**: Ctrl+Shift+Delete → Clear cached images and files
2. **Check Network tab**: Look for failed API calls
3. **Verify backend**: Ensure backend is running on port 8000
4. **Check WebSocket**: Look for ws:// or wss:// connections in Network tab

## 📊 Applied Fixes Summary

1. **Rate Limit API**: Fixed environment variable from `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL` to `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE`
2. **Error Boundary**: Now shows errors instead of blank screen
3. **WebSocket Protocol**: Dynamically selects ws:// or wss:// based on page protocol
4. **FeedMe Integration**: All imports and dependencies verified

## 🎉 Expected Result

You should now see:
- Rate limit indicator displaying current usage
- FeedMe working without console errors
- Smooth user experience with proper error handling

## 📝 Notes

- Frontend running on port **3001** (3000 was in use)
- All environment variables correctly configured
