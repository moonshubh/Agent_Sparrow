Customer: Hi, I'm having trouble connecting my Gmail account to Mailbird. It keeps showing an authentication error.

Agent: Hello! I'd be happy to help you connect your Gmail account to Mailbird. The authentication error usually happens when Gmail blocks less secure apps. Let me guide you through the solution.

Customer: OK, what should I do?

Agent: First, make sure you're using an App Password instead of your regular Gmail password. Here's how:
1. Go to your Google Account settings
2. Navigate to Security
3. Enable 2-Step Verification if not already enabled
4. Under "Signing in to Google", select "App passwords"
5. Generate a new app password for Mailbird
6. Use this app password in Mailbird instead of your regular password

Customer: I see. Let me try that. Where do I enter this app password in Mailbird?

Agent: In Mailbird:
1. Go to Settings (gear icon)
2. Click on Accounts
3. Select your Gmail account
4. Update the password field with the app password
5. Click Save

Customer: That worked! Thank you so much. One more question - how do I set up multiple Gmail accounts?

Agent: Great question! You can add multiple Gmail accounts in Mailbird:
1. Go to Settings â†’ Accounts
2. Click "Add Account"
3. Select Gmail
4. Follow the same app password process for each account
5. You can switch between accounts using the account selector

Customer: Perfect, that's exactly what I needed. Thanks for your help!

Agent: You're welcome! Is there anything else I can help you with regarding your Mailbird setup?

Customer: No, that's all. Have a great day!

Agent: You too! Don't hesitate to reach out if you need any further assistance.
