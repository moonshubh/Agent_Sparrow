# Brainstorming Skill

## Overview

Structured ideation framework that transforms vague ideas into concrete designs through systematic questioning, alternative generation, and critical evaluation. Based on the obra/superpowers brainstorming methodology.

## When to Use

- Feature brainstorming for product improvements
- Problem-solving complex support escalations
- Generating alternative solutions to user issues
- Exploring design space before implementation
- Breaking through creative blocks

## Core Principles

1. **Diverge before converging** - Generate many options before evaluating
2. **Question assumptions** - Challenge "obvious" constraints
3. **Seek alternatives** - Never settle on first idea
4. **Build on ideas** - "Yes, and..." rather than "No, but..."
5. **Defer judgment** - Separate ideation from evaluation

## Brainstorming Phases

### Phase 1: Problem Framing

```markdown
## Problem Definition

**What is the core problem?**
[State in one sentence]

**Who experiences this problem?**
- Primary users:
- Secondary affected:

**What happens if unsolved?**
- Impact on users:
- Impact on business:

**What constraints exist?**
- Technical:
- Resource:
- Time:

**What does success look like?**
[Measurable outcome]
```

### Phase 2: Divergent Ideation

```markdown
## Idea Generation

**Obvious solutions** (start here)
1.
2.
3.

**Opposite approaches** (invert the problem)
1. What if we did the opposite?
2. What if we removed X instead of adding?
3. What if users did this themselves?

**Analogies** (how do others solve similar problems?)
1. How does [industry] handle this?
2. What would [company] do?
3. Historical solutions to similar problems?

**10x thinking** (if resources were unlimited)
1.
2.
3.

**Minimum viable** (smallest possible solution)
1.
2.
3.
```

### Phase 3: Devil's Advocate

```markdown
## Critical Evaluation

For each promising idea, ask:

**Why might this fail?**
-

**Who would hate this?**
-

**What's the hidden cost?**
-

**What assumption could be wrong?**
-

**How could this backfire?**
-
```

### Phase 4: Synthesis

```markdown
## Solution Synthesis

**Selected approach:**
[Description]

**Why this over alternatives:**
1.
2.
3.

**Risks and mitigations:**
| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|------------|
|      |            |

**First steps:**
1.
2.
3.

**Open questions:**
-
```

## Structured Techniques

### SCAMPER Method

Apply each lens to existing solutions:

| Lens | Question |
|------|----------|
| **S**ubstitute | What can be replaced? |
| **C**ombine | What can be merged? |
| **A**dapt | What can be borrowed from elsewhere? |
| **M**odify | What can be changed in form or quality? |
| **P**ut to other use | What else could this do? |
| **E**liminate | What can be removed? |
| **R**everse | What if we flip the process? |

### Six Thinking Hats

Rotate through perspectives:

| Hat | Focus |
|-----|-------|
| White | Facts and data only |
| Red | Emotions and intuition |
| Black | Caution and risks |
| Yellow | Benefits and optimism |
| Green | Creativity and alternatives |
| Blue | Process and summary |

### 5 Whys

Drill into root cause:

```
Problem: Users complain about X

Why? → Because Y happens
Why? → Because Z is configured
Why? → Because W was assumed
Why? → Because V was never tested
Why? → Because U was the original design
       ↳ ROOT CAUSE
```

## Support Escalation Brainstorm

For complex support issues:

```markdown
## Escalation Brainstorm: [Issue Title]

**Symptoms observed:**
-
-

**Already tried:**
- [ ] Solution A - Result:
- [ ] Solution B - Result:

**Alternative hypotheses:**
1. Root cause is actually...
2. Could be caused by...
3. Maybe unrelated to...

**Unconventional approaches:**
1.
2.

**Expert to consult:**
-

**Next experiment:**
-
```

## Feature Ideation Template

```markdown
## Feature Brainstorm: [Feature Area]

**User need:**
[One sentence]

**Current state:**
[How users handle this today]

**Idea spectrum:**

| Minimal | Standard | Deluxe |
|---------|----------|--------|
| [Quick fix] | [Solid solution] | [Full vision] |

**Unique angles:**
1.
2.
3.

**Validation approach:**
- How to test cheaply:
- Success metric:

**Decision:**
[ ] Proceed with:
[ ] Park for later
[ ] Need more research
```

## Quick Reference

| Technique | When to Use | Output |
|-----------|-------------|--------|
| Problem Framing | Start of any brainstorm | Clear problem statement |
| SCAMPER | Improving existing solutions | Modification ideas |
| Six Hats | Group decisions | Balanced perspectives |
| 5 Whys | Root cause analysis | True underlying issue |
| Devil's Advocate | Before committing | Risk awareness |

## Integration with Agent Sparrow

- **Feature Ideas**: Structured exploration for product improvements
- **Escalation Support**: Generate alternative solutions for stuck tickets
- **Process Design**: Brainstorm workflow improvements
- **Customer Solutions**: Creative problem-solving for edge cases

## Best Practices

1. **Time-box ideation** - 15-30 minutes max before evaluating
2. **Capture everything** - No idea too small or silly
3. **Build combinations** - Best ideas often combine others
4. **Sleep on it** - Major decisions benefit from incubation
5. **Involve others** - Fresh perspectives break patterns
